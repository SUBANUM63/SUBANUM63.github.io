        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Health Queue project was born out of a need to address the inefficiencies and frustrations commonly experienced in healthcare facilities. Long waiting times, mismanaged appointments, and a lack of real-time communication between patients and healthcare providers were some of the major issues identified. These challenges not only affect patient satisfaction but also impact the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the vision of a seamless and efficient healthcare experience, Health Queue aims to revolutionize the way patient queues are managed. By leveraging modern technology, our system provides real-time updates, easy appointment scheduling, and automated notifications, ensuring that patients spend less time waiting and more time receiving the care they need.</p>
        <p>The development of Health Queue was driven by extensive research and collaboration with healthcare professionals to understand their pain points and requirements. Our goal is to create a user-friendly, secure, and reliable solution that not only enhances the patient experience but also supports healthcare providers in delivering high-quality care.</p>
